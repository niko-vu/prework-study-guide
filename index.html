            <li>The &lt;head&gt; element contains information about the webpage.</li>
            <li>The &lt;body&gt; element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            <li>The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; element is a declaration telling the browser what document type it should expect.</li>
            <li>The &lt;title&gt; element is for search engine optimization (SEO).</li>
            <li>&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; are used for unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
            <li>&lt;br&gt; creates a line of empty space (or a linebreak) between 2 blocks of code.</li>
            <li>&lt;a&gt; stands for anchor which creates a link... and "href" in &lt;a href&gt; points to the url for the link.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS: cascading-style sheets... what is used to stylize HTML</li>
            <li>Internal CSS style sheet contains both the CSS and the HTML in one location (ex. how Neocities operates).</li>
            <li>external CSS style sheet: keeping all CSS rules in a separate file</li>
            <li>When using an external CSS style sheet, we link the file using a &lt;link&gt; element placed in the HTML's &lt;head&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" />&gt;</li>
            <li>A period preceeding a word creates a new class selector (if it does not already exist)</li> and any HTML element assigned to the class .card
            will gain these property assignments
            <li>"margin" property is for space <b>outside</b> of an element</li>
            <li>"padding" property is for space <b>inside</b> of an element</li>
            <li>"display" property is paired with block (display: block) so that it assigns each image to start on a new line</li>
            <li>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css"&gt;</li>
              <ul>
                <li>rel specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource
                <li>href specifies the location (URL) of the external resource</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A JavaScript file is .js</li>
          <li>To link script.js file to the index.html file, we must insert this -> "&lt;script src="./assets/script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This is placed between &lt;footer&gt; and &lt;body&gt;</li>
          </ul>
          <li>To declare a variable, we use the "var" keyword (ex. var shape = "circle";)</li>
          <li>For these to be visible in the console, we need to output the message to the web console by using the console.log method and adding an argument to it as well (ex. console.log(shapes);</li>
          <li>To see what's in the console, inspect element</li>
          <li>JavaScript has a control flow where the placement of things matters! It can, however, be interrupted using conditional statements and loops.</li>
          <li>The if statement is an example of how to create a conditional statement (ex. if (condition) { //block of code to be executed if condition is truthy })</li>
          <li>An array can be used to change the value of our variables in a more efficient way</li>
            <ul>
              <li>array: a group of related data</li>
              <li>ex. var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</li>
              <li>The shapes listed are all strings unlike a variable like the number "54" (number) or the word "true" (Boolean value)</li>
              <li>In an array, each item is assigned an index according to the order in which it is stored (starting with the number 0!)</li>
              <li>To log "triangle," we would type console.log(shapes[0]); as it is the first variable in the array</li>
           </ul>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array</li>
          <li>It is much like an equation....</li>
          <li>ex. for(var x = 0; x &lt; shapes.length; x++) { console.log(shapes[x]); } </li>
          <li>The types of JavaScript data types are "null, undefined, boolean, number, bigint, string, and symbol"</li>
          <li>function: a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
          <li>ex. function listTopics() { for (var x = 0; x &lt; topics.length; x++) { console.log(topics[x]); } }</li>
          <li>At the bottom of the .js file, in order for functions like listTopics() and selectTopic() to work, we must put them at the end of the file with a console.log above them as well</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b <i>branch-name</i>: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: stages your changes, using "add -A" to commit all files in the working branch</li>
          <li>git commit -m "<i>watever you want to say</i>": commits saved stages to our repository</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls in the base branch (should see something like "Already up to date.")</li>
          <li>git push origin "<i>feature name</i>: pushes up all of our changes (the feature name was "feature/add-html" so I typed "git push origin feature/add-html")</li>
          <ul>
            <li>After this, we can now go back to GitHub and create a new pull request and wait for a merge.</li>
            <li>Go back to terminal and update local repository with the NEWLY merged-in feature with "git checkout main" "git pull origin main"</li>
          </ul>
            <li>touch: a command in git to create a new file (ex. touch style.css)</li>
          <li>git checkout -b <i>feature/add-css</i>: checkout -> move from branch to branch; -b: add a new branch</li>

        <h2>Git Diary</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I added this section just because the mistake I made will be a great learning lesson.</li>
            <li>I just used git commit -m "added code to HTML file" in my terminal because I'm trying to commit my stages and also the "-m" flag is used to associate a message with
          our commit lol.
        I blew up the terminal somehow--it gave me like a horrifying message but it's okay I fixed it with git restore or something like that. Ok so always add a message after
        -m. Got it.</li>

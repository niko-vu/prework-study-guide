## Description

While I was working on this Pre-work Study Guide project, what motivated me the most was the anticipation I had for what the completed version was going to look like. I built this project because I wanted to really learn the process by partaking IN the process. I'm a very detail-oriented person and I learn the best when I am participating in something first-hand. With something like coding--that's the best way you can learn and really develop the knowledge of and the muscle memory for structuring coding languages. I solved several problems with the project: coding errors here and there and tackling my lack of experience with JavaScript (of which I know very little of). I learned more about HTML, CSS, coding technicalities, and my own capabilities and enjoyment of coding. ^_^
